# gw

Locate a Gradle project and use an interactive cli to interact with your build.  

At the moment it's more an excuse to play with [Gradle Tooling API](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/third_party_integration.html#embedding) ðŸ˜‡

# Usage

    gw <tasks>
	
or just get interactive:

    gw

# Build

    ./gradlew build
